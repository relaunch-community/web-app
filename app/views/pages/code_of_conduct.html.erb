        This code of conduct applies to all spaces the Relaunch Community manages,
        including IRC, Slack, public and private mailing lists, issue trackers,
        wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channels our
        communities use. A code of conduct which is specific to in-person
        events (ie., conferences) is in
        the <%= link_to "anti-harassment policy", anti_harassment_url %>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We expect everyone who participates in the Relaunch community formally or informally,
        or claims any affiliation with the Foundation, in any Foundation-related
        activities and especially when representing the ASF in any role to honor this code of conduct.
      </p>

      <p>
        This code <u>is not exhaustive or complete</u>. It distills our common understanding of a collaborative, shared
        environment and goals.
        We expect all members of the Relaunch community to follow it in spirit as much as in the letter,
        so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 -indent-6">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Be open.</span>
          We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use public methods
          of communication for group-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.
          This applies to messages for help or group-related support, too;
          not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a
          question, it also makes sure that any the community notices and corrects any
          inadvertent mistakes people answering the query may make.
        </li>
        <li>

          <span class="font-semibold">Be <a href="#endnotes">empathetic</a>
          , welcoming, friendly, and patient.</span>
          We work together to resolve conflicts,
          assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion.
          We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow
          frustration to result in a personal attack. A community where people feel
          uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be
          respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people
          outside our community.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Be collaborative.</span>
          Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on the work of others.
          When we make something for the benefit of the group, we are
          willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the work to
          make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users
          and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Be inquisitive.</span>
          Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later,
          so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to the appropriate
          forum. Those who receive a question should be responsive and helpful,
          within the context of our shared goals.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Be careful in the words that we choose.</span>
          Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value
          professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own
          speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
          Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable.
          This includes, but is not limited to:

          <div class="flex shrink border-2 border-gray-600 text-gray-600 md:ml-8 mt-2 -indent-4">

              <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
              <li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
              <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
              <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
              <li>Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or from unlogged forums such
                as IRC channel history.
              </li>
              <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
              <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
              <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
              <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="space-y-1">
          <span class="font-semibold">Be concise.</span>
          Keep in mind that, over time, hundreds or thousands of people will read what you write.
          Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible.
          Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient.
          When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary at the top of the message.

          <p>
            Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each email adds something unique to the thread, keeping in
            mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been
            made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Step down considerately.</span> Volunteers/organizers of every group come and go.
          When somebody leaves or disengages from the group they should tell
          people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can
          pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of
          those who continue to participate in the group and should not misrepresent the
          group's goals or achievements.
          Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the group.

      <p>
        Relaunch Community welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a
        community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will
        always work to treat everyone well.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you, we welcome you.
        Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity,
        genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs,
        profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Relaunch Community development takes place in English.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Code of Conduct, above, details our standards for behaviour in the Relaunch Community.
        We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their
        interactions and to help others to do so.

        <%= link_to "Reporting Guidelines", "#reporting-guidelines" %>
      </h2>

      <p>
        While all participants should adhere to this code of conduct, we recognize that
        sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the code's guidelines.
        When that happens, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct.
        Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate.
        However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
        adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in
        particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour
        than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.
        Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your
        compliance issues in confidence to:

        <span class="font-semibold">Empathetic</span> is the adjectival form of empathy.
