      [Re] Launch Community will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites.
      We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data,
      but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us
      personal
      information, we won't do anything evil with it.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details
      before

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      Like most website operators, [Re] Launch Community collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
      and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
      time
      of each visitor request. [Re] Launch Community's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
      understand
      how [Re] Launch Community's visitors use its website. From time to time, [Re] Launch Community may release non-personally-identifying information in
      the
      aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      [Re] Launch Community also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. [Re] Launch Community does
      not
      use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under
      the
      same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also
      collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    </h5>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      Certain visitors to [Re] Launch Community's websites choose to interact with [Re] Launch Community in ways that require [Re] Launch Community to gather
      personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that [Re] Launch Community gathers depends on the nature of
      the
      interaction. [Re] Launch Community collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of
      the
      visitor's interaction with [Re] Launch Community. [Re] Launch Community does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
      below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
      prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For
      instance,
      when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is
      displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and
      the
      convenience of the user.

    <h5>
      Aggregated Statistics
    </h5>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">

      popular parts of the relaunchcommunity.org. [Re] Launch Community may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, [Re] Launch Community
      does not

    <h5>
      Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    </h5>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      [Re] Launch Community discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
      employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it
      on
      [Re] Launch Community's behalf or to provide services available at [Re] Launch Community's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
      others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
      country;
      by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. [Re] Launch Community will not rent or sell
      potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors
      and
      affiliated organizations, as described above, [Re] Launch Community discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when [Re] Launch Community believes in good faith that
      disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of [Re] Launch Community, third parties or the public at
      large.
      If
      you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, [Re] Launch Community may occasionally send you an
      email
      to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with [Re] Launch Community
      and
      our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
      this
      type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
      mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
      us
      support other users. [Re] Launch Community takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
      alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

    </h5>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
      provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. [Re] Launch Community uses cookies to help [Re] Launch Community identify and track visitors,
      their usage of [Re] Launch Community Service, and their Service access preferences. [Re] Launch Community visitors who do not wish to have cookies
      placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using [Re] Launch Community's websites, with the
      drawback
      that certain features of [Re] Launch Community's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

    <h5>
      Privacy Policy Changes
    </h5>

    <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 leading-normal">
      Although most changes are likely to be minor, [Re] Launch Community may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in [Re] Launch Community's
      sole
      discretion. [Re] Launch Community encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your
