# [Re] Launch Community - Web App

Web app for the [Re] Launch Community @ https://relaunchcommunity.org

## Community

Launching and/or relaunching a startup is hard and lonely; do it in the company of other startup founders!

Startups are companies which are, “designed to grow fast.” If you’re looking for product-market fit and/or explosive growth, then you’re in the right place.

If you’re starting a small-business aimed at steady growth, that’s fantastic and commendable, but this isn’t the group for you.

The process of starting up can be long, winding, and lonely; [Re] Launch's goal is to provide a community for founders. In service of this goal, I ask that you be respectful of and to each-other and the group.
